# Welcome to the iNap Malinka main page!
Here you'll find everything about the project. Remember that it's still a work in progress! <s>despite spending my entire vacation on this project</s>
Consider donating me a cup of milk:

## What's iNap Malinka?
It was mostly made as a decent Raspberry based NRF24L01 transmitter, but as it turns out you can play some games on this. You can install RetroPie so any retro game, including ports, can be played on Malinka. But as it's mostly a device for tinkering on-the-go, there's additional USB for any kind of peripheral, HDMI port, and a decent audio section too.
Not only that, it's just as big as your phone, with only 12mm thickness. Two joysticks, 3.5" capacitive touch screen, powered by Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.  
But, if you're just interested about gaming, you can totally ignore the radio section and use it as a small, DIY handheld!
Formally it's a mobile HMI, as besides of NRF24L01 you can use WiFi and Bluetooth to control your devices!!

## Why Malinka?
* extremely small size compared to other pi handhelds
* big, colorful LCD with touch!
* two joysticks allowing to play more modern games
* NRF24L01 radio makes it a perfect remote!!
* only 3 external ICs, **without** any aux microcontroller
* stereo sound output and a headphone jack
* with a keyboard, it can act as a little PC
* uses parts from Nintendo Switch
## Why NOT?
* if you're a fan of Steam Deck, this device is probably too small for you
* lack of joystick pushbuttons as well as analog triggers
* many tools are needed to assembly
* intermediate soldering skills are needed
* uses parts from Nintendo Switch

## Specifications
* 3.5" 480x320 ILI9488 screen with FT6236 capacitive touch controller
