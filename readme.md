  <h1>✨ Welcome to the iNap Malinka main page! ✨</h1>
</div>

**iNap Malinka** was mostly made as a decent Raspberry Pi based NRF24L01 transmitter. But as it turns out you can play some games on it as well! It's a small DIY handheld that runs RetroPie so any retro game, including ports, can be played on Malinka. But as it's mostly a device for tinkering on-the-go, there's an additional USB for any kind of peripheral, an HDMI port, and a decent audio section too.
Not only that, it's just as big as your phone, with only 12mm thickness. Two joysticks, 3.5" capacitive touch screen, powered by Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.  
But, if you're interested just about gaming, you can totally ignore the radio section and use it as a small, DIY handheld!
Formally it's a mobile Human-Machine Interface (HMI), as besides the NRF24L01 you can use WiFi and Bluetooth to control your devices!!

## ❤ Why Malinka?
* small and compact size
* big, colorful LCD with touch!
* two joysticks allowing more modern games to be played
* NRF24L01 radio makes it a perfect remote!!
* only 3 external ICs, **without** any aux microcontroller
* stereo sound output and a headphone jack
* custom overlay
* with a keyboard, it can act as a little PC
* uses parts from Nintendo Switch

## 💔 Why NOT?
* if you're a fan of Steam Deck, this device is probably too small for you
* lack of joystick pushbuttons as well as analog triggers
* many tools are needed for assembly
* intermediate soldering skills are needed
* uses parts from Nintendo Switch

## 🚀 Features
* 3.5" 480x320 ILI9488 screen with FT6236 capacitive touch controller
* Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
* 1500mAh lipo battery
* 160x70x12mm (with case)
* two joysticks with 10 bit ADC MCP3008
